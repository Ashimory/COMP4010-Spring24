The following code chunk demonstrates how to add alternative text to a bar chart. The alternative text is added to the chunk header using the `fig-alt` chunk option. The text is written in Markdown and can be as long as needed. Note that fig-cap is not the same as `fig-alt`.

```{r}
#| label: nurses-bar
#| fig-cap: "Total employed Registered Nurses"
#| fig-alt: "The figure is a bar chart titled 'Total employed Registered
#| Nurses' that displays the numbers of registered nurses in three states
#| (California, New York, and North Carolina) over a 20 year period, with data
#| recorded in three time points (2000, 2010, and 2020). In each state, the
#| numbers of registered nurses increase over time. The following numbers are
#| all approximate. California started off with 200K registered nurses in 2000,
#| 240K in 2010, and 300K in 2020. New York had 150K in 2000, 160K in 2010, and
#| 170K in 2020. Finally North Carolina had 60K in 2000, 90K in 2010, and 100K
#| in 2020."

# Task 3. Colorblind-friendly plots
Use `colorblindr` for colorblind-friendly palettes.
```{r}
#remotes::install_github("wilkelab/cowplot")
#install.packages("colorspace", repos = "http://R-Forge.R-project.org")
#remotes::install_github("clauswilke/colorblindr")
library(colorblindr)
```

Try out colorblind simulations at http://hclwizard.org/cvdemulator/ or |> your plot to `cvd_grid()` to see the plot in various color-vision-deficiency simulations.

With the line chart from Task 1, create 3 different plots: one with the default color scale, one with the `viridis` color scale, and one with the `OkabeIto` color scale from `colorblindr`. Show the `cvd_grid()` of each plot and describe the simulated effectiveness of the color scales for colorblind viewers.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE

```

# Task 4. Direct labelling instead of legends

Refer to this page: https://r-graph-gallery.com/web-line-chart-with-labels-at-end-of-line.html

Create a version of the same line chart but using direct labels instead of legends. Show the `cvd_grid()` and describe how this can be helpful.
